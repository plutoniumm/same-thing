Create (same-thing) apps with no build configuration.

Create (same-thing) App works on macOS, Linux and other Unix systems<br>
[htmx / skill-issue (same thing)](https://htmx.org/) itself however, runs basically anywhere you can run Doom. All you need is a CPU, some form of memory and networking <br/>
If something doesnâ€™t work, please [file an issue](https://github.com/plutoniumm/same-thing/issues/new).

> *USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. BUGGY AND INCOMPLETE*

## Supported Backends
See templates over at [htmx-templates](https://www.github.com/plutoniumm/htmx-templates), however `same-thing` will auto-install them anyway
