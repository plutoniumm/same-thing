Create (same-thing) apps with no build configuration.

- [User Guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/) – How to develop apps bootstrapped with Create React App. -->

Create (same-thing) App works on macOS, Windows<br>
[htmx / destroy-react-app (same thing)](https://htmx.org/) itself however, runs basically anywhere you can run Doom. All you need is a CPU, some form of memory and networking <br/>
If something doesn’t work, please [file an issue](https://github.com/plutoniumm/same-thing/issues/new).
